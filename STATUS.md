# Noi — project status

Last updated: 2026-05-14

## Where we are

Phase 1 complete and **shipped to production** at `https://noi-app.com`. Custom domain configured with Resend SMTP (verified domain — magic links can go to any recipient). Both parent and child accounts tested end-to-end on real devices with real emails. Several post-launch UX improvements landed: tappable phone numbers, TTS on every message with slower Vietnamese rate, broader TTS coverage, tightened translation prompts, parent language preference toggle, child unified composer (Parent/Noi destination toggle), voice input for child, and image attachments with Claude vision integration.

### What's verified working

- ✅ Magic link auth (send → email → click → callback → setup)
- ✅ Family space creation + invite code join
- ✅ Parent home (mic + text input + recent threads list)
- ✅ Streaming AI responses (`/api/chat` route with dual-language save + checklist extraction + title generation)
- ✅ Vietnamese TTS speaker button on assistant messages
- ✅ Checklist extraction and tap-to-complete
- ✅ RLS policies (using `SECURITY DEFINER` helper function — see "Gotchas" below)

### Built but awaiting end-to-end test

- ⬜ Child dashboard with realtime thread list
- ⬜ Child thread view (message bubbles, language toggle, category selector, mark-resolved)
- ⬜ Child adds context → AI re-streams response
- ⬜ Child reply → translated to Vietnamese → appears in parent's thread
- ⬜ Child new-task flow (compose → preview → submit → parent sees highlighted thread)
- ⬜ Settings page (display name, language toggle, family code)
- ⬜ Realtime updates (parent home, parent thread, child home, child thread)

### Phase 1 ship checklist

1. ~~Rotate the three leaked credentials~~ — ✅ done.
2. ~~Set an Anthropic spending cap~~ — ✅ done.
3. ~~Configure custom SMTP (Resend)~~ — ✅ done.
4. ~~Initialise git + push to GitHub~~ — ✅ at https://github.com/ttluu2-1807/Noi.
5. ~~Deploy to Vercel~~ — ✅ live at https://noi-app.com.
6. ~~Custom domain + verified Resend sender~~ — ✅ `noi@noi-app.com`.
7. ~~Run a two-account walkthrough~~ — ✅ both parent + child verified on real devices.

### Backlog — current sprint (Phase 2)

Three waves of ~2-3 hours each. Tackled in order. Each wave is independently shippable.

**Wave 1 — Responsiveness + polish**

| Item | Detail | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Optimistic UI + tap feedback on every button/form action | ⬜ |
| F | Replace header pill row with avatar/menu sheet (mobile-friendly) | ⬜ |
| B.1 | Restyle thread cards: message preview snippet, image thumb, better time format, hover lift | ⬜ |

**Wave 2 — Organization at scale**

| Item | Detail | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C | Multi-tag system (drop single category_tag, allow custom tags from both roles) | ⬜ |
| D | Open / Done tabs on dashboard with counts | ⬜ |
| E | Mark-resolved affordance on parent thread view (currently child-only) | ⬜ |
| G | Inside-thread tabs: Conversation vs Action items | ⬜ |

**Wave 3 — Trust + warmth for elderly users**

| Item | Detail | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H | First-run 3-screen onboarding tour for parent | ⬜ |
| I | In-app unread indicator on threads with new content from other role | ⬜ |
| J | Suggested-question prompts in empty states | ⬜ |
| K | Warm localised error states (no raw errors to parent) | ⬜ |
| M | Auto-TTS toggle on assistant responses (settings opt-in) | ⬜ |

### Killer features — Phase 2 strategic bets

Heavier (week-plus each) but the biggest retention drivers.

| Item | Detail | Status |
|---|---|---|
| KILLER-1 | Reminders / nudges — parent commits to "call Centrelink Friday", app reminds them Friday morning. Needs scheduled jobs, push or email, calendar export. | ⬜ |
| KILLER-2 | Family member presence — "Mai is viewing this thread", "Mai is typing". Realtime broadcast over Supabase Presence channels. Strong family-warmth signal. | ⬜ |
| KILLER-3 | Voice mode end-to-end for parent — instead of read-typed-text, AI speaks the response, parent can voice-reply. Needs server-side STT (Whisper) for reliable Vietnamese on iPhone, plus optional ElevenLabs TTS. | ⬜ |

### Smaller backlog (revisit when relevant)

| Item | Detail | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Iterative AI refinement on new-task (back-and-forth before submit) | ⬜ |
| 2 | Delete past tasks (soft delete) | ⬜ |
| 4 | AI presents visuals to user (design still unclear — revisit with concrete use case) | ⬜ |
| L | Search across threads | ⬜ |
| O | A−/A+ font size escalation for accessibility | ⬜ |
| — | Onboarding for child role (currently parent-only planned) | ⬜ |

### Performance backlog (post-Wave-3 navigation polish)

After landing loading.tsx skeletons (which cut perceived navigation
delay by ~80%), three further levers remain. Ordered by impact-per-hour.

| Item | Detail | Status | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERF-1 | **Suspense streaming inside thread page** — split the page's server fetch into Suspense boundaries so the top half (back link, title, status, tabs) renders the moment its data is ready, while heavier fetches (family tag list, full checklist) stream in below. Best win-to-effort ratio. | ⬜ | ~45-90 min |
| PERF-2 | **Combine queries** — collapse the 4-5 separate Supabase queries into fewer round trips via a Postgres function or view that returns thread + messages + checklist + tags in one shot. Cuts round-trip latency. | ⬜ | ~2 hr (needs SQL migration) |
| PERF-3 | **Client-side last-viewed cache** — when user taps a thread card, the title / preview / tags are already known. Pre-render the thread page header from cached data the instant the user taps, well before the server fetch resolves. True instant feel like Twitter/Instagram. | ⬜ | ~3-4 hr |
| PERF-4 | **View Transitions API** — animated morphing of thread card into thread page header. Polish, not perf, but huge "app-like" perception win. | ⬜ | ~1-2 hr (experimental browser API) |
| PERF-5 | **Reduce dashboard query** — currently fetch ALL threads (no limit on parent). Cap at 30-50, paginate the rest. | ⬜ | ~30 min |

### Already-shipped post-launch work (for reference)

- ✅ Tappable phone numbers + URL auto-detection in messages
- ✅ TTS on every message with slower Vietnamese rate
- ✅ Tightened translation prompts (elder-friendly Vietnamese register)
- ✅ Parent English/Vietnamese language toggle
- ✅ Child voice-to-text composer
- ✅ Child unified Parent/Noi destination toggle
- ✅ Image attachments with Claude vision
- ✅ Custom domain `noi-app.com` with verified Resend SMTP

## Gotchas learned during this build

### 1. Claude Desktop injects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` into spawned shells

Claude Desktop exports an empty `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` into the environment of any terminal it spawns (presumably so its own Claude Code process can own the binding). Next.js's env loader does not override already-set shell vars, so the empty string wins over the real key in `.env.local`, and every call to the Anthropic SDK fails with:

> Could not resolve authentication method. Expected either apiKey or authToken to be set.

**Mitigation in place**: the `dev` script in `package.json` is wrapped in `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so the phantom var is stripped before `next dev` runs. This is Unix-only — if you port to Windows, swap in `cross-env` or an equivalent.

### 2. Self-referential RLS policies on `profiles` don't work

The original schema in the spec had `profiles` RLS policies that selected from `profiles` inside the `using` clause. Postgres breaks the recursion by returning an empty set, which means the user can't even read their own row — causing an infinite `/setup` redirect loop. We replaced all policies with ones that call a `SECURITY DEFINER` function (`public.current_user_family_space_id()`) that resolves the user's family without triggering RLS.

The fixed SQL is in [SECURITY-TODO.md](SECURITY-TODO.md) and has already been applied to your Supabase project.

### 3. Supabase PKCE flow needs the modern cookie API

`@supabase/ssr` v0.5+ exposes both a `get/set/remove` cookie contract (deprecated) and a `getAll/setAll` contract (current). The deprecated API can drop the PKCE verifier cookie between "send magic link" and the callback, producing:

> PKCE code verifier not found in storage…

Both `lib/supabase/server.ts` and `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` use the modern contract.

### 4. React 18 StrictMode + "run-once" effects

Dev-mode StrictMode invokes every effect twice. If an effect with a network call uses a `startedRef.current` guard, the first invocation is aborted by cleanup and the second is blocked by the guard — net result: zero requests. The correct pattern is to let both invocations fire and rely on `AbortController` in cleanup. `components/StreamingResponse.tsx` follows this pattern.

### 5. Next.js 14 `<form action={fn}>` requires `Promise<void>`

Server actions bound directly to a form element can't return a result object — the type is strictly `Promise<void>`. Actions used via `startTransition` can return whatever they like. Mixed needs are handled by having two exports, or by making the action `Promise<void>` and managing error state on the client.

### 6. Next.js 14 vs Next.js 16 false positives from hooks

The hook system that validates files as you write them is tuned for Next 16 defaults (`await cookies()`, `await headers()`, `await searchParams`, `middleware.ts → proxy.ts`). Everything in this codebase is Next 14, where those primitives are still synchronous and the middleware filename is still `middleware.ts`. Ignore those specific suggestions unless you upgrade.

## How to run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Dev server on http://localhost:3000. Env vars live in `.env.local` (see `.env.local.example`).

If you run `next dev` directly instead of via npm, you must strip the phantom env var yourself:

```bash
env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY next dev
```
